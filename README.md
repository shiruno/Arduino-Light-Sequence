The code sequentially turns on each of the five output pins (10, 9, 8, 7, and 6) for 1 second each, followed by turning them off in the same order, with a 1-second delay between each action.
    
This results in a visual effect where, if LEDs are connected to these pins, they will light up one after the other and then turn off in the same order, creating a "chasing" effect.
